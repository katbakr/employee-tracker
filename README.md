  ## Description
  This application is meant to make it easy to access departments, employees, and jobs in an organization. The particular example that I used to seed this application was a store with various departments, jobs that could be found in those particular departments, and fake employees that hold those jobs. This application can be used to easily see a list of departments and add a new department. See a list of jobs that are in the database and their salary/manager. And to see a list of employees, their job, salary, and manager. 

  ## Installation
  This project does require a few steps for installation: 
  * First step is to clone this repository into your local vscode through GitHub 
  * You will need to have Node.js, inquirer, console.table, and mysql2 
  * Next once you have the neccesary packaged installed, type node server.js into the command line and you should be seeing different options to view data and add new data, keep in mind that there will be no data in the database if you have not seeded it prior to running it in the CLI!
